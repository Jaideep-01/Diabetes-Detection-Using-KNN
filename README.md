# Diabetes-Detection-Using-KNN

This repository contains a Python project that implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not based on various health-related features. The features used for prediction include:

1. Pregnancies
2. Glucose level
3. Blood Pressure
4. Skin Thickness
5. Insulin level
6. BMI (Body Mass Index)
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function
8. Age

# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify individuals into two categories: those with diabetes and those without. KNN is a simple yet effective algorithm for classification tasks that makes predictions based on the similarity of data points in the feature space.

# Libraries Used
1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Numpy
4. Seaborn
